# **Sentiment Analysis using LSTM-RNN**

This project builds a complete **Sentiment Analysis** model using **Deep Learning (LSTM)** to classify restaurant reviews as **positive** or **negative**.
It includes data preprocessing, tokenization, embedding, model training, evaluation, and prediction using Keras and TensorFlow.

---

## ** Project Overview**

This notebook demonstrates:

* Cleaning and preprocessing text data
* Tokenizing and padding sentences
* Generating word embeddings
* Building an LSTM-based neural network
* Training the sentiment classifier
* Predicting sentiment for new user input

A custom dataset of **200 restaurant reviews** is included for realistic training.

## **⚙️ Features**

**Text Preprocessing**

* Lowercasing
* Removing punctuation
* Stopword removal
* Lemmatization

**Tokenization & Padding**

* Keras Tokenizer
* Sequence padding for equal input length

**Deep Learning Pipeline**

* Embedding layer
* LSTM layer
* Dense output for binary classification

**Evaluation**

* Accuracy tracking
* Loss curve interpretation

**Prediction Module**
A simple function:

```python
predict_review("The food was amazing!")
```

Returns:

```
('Positive', 0.97)
```

---

## ** Requirements**

Install required libraries:

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras nltk numpy
```

Download NLTK dependencies:

```python
import nltk
nltk.download("stopwords")
nltk.download("wordnet")
```

---

## **Model Architecture**

The LSTM model used:

```python
model = Sequential([
    Embedding(vocab_size, embed_dim, input_length=max_len),
    LSTM(64),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])
```

* Optimizer: Adam
* Loss: Binary Crossentropy
* Metric: Accuracy

---

## ** Training Performance**

The model typically reaches:

* Accuracy between **90% and 99%**
* Consistent reduction in loss across epochs

---

## ** Making Predictions**

```python
predict_review("The food is bad")
predict_review("Absolutely delicious biryani!")
```

Sample output:

```
('Negative', 0.04)
('Positive', 0.98)
```

Values closer to 1 represent strongly positive sentiment.

---

## ** Future Enhancements**

Potential upgrades for the project:

* Use **Bidirectional LSTMs**
* Integrate **GloVe or Word2Vec** embeddings
* Build a **Streamlit UI** for real-time predictions
* Convert to a **FastAPI endpoint**
* Move to **transformer models (BERT, DistilBERT)**
* Expand the dataset further
